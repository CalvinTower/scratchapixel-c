============================== CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES ==============================

In brief: please don't.

Which is to say that this is a personal project that I'm taking on as
a way to practice writing code, using Git and GitHub, and learn about
3D rendering algorithms. Like a really big homework project just for
my own personal betterment.

All that said, there is a very VERY important way that you (yes, you)
could contribute to this project:

Please give me advice.

I'm new to coding, to CG graphics, to all of it. I'm so new, you
guys. And I'm very, very happy to accept any advice, critique, or what
have you. There is no learning in a vacuum, and I would love nothing
more than for you all to fill my learning vacuum with information and
advice.

Thank you very much,
Calvin Tower
