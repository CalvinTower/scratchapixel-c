============================== CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES ==============================

In brief: please don't.

Which is to say that this is a personal project that I'm taking on as
a way to practice writing code, using Git and GitHub, and learn about
3D rendering algorithms. Like a really big homework project just for
my own personal betterment.

All that said, there is a very VERY important way that you (yes, you)
could contribute to this project:

Please give me advice.

I'm new to coding, to CG graphics, to all of it. I'm so new, you
guys. And I'm very, very happy to accept any advice, critique, or what
have you. There is no learning in a vacuum, and I would love nothing
more than for you all to fill my learning vacuum with information and
advice.

Thank you very much,
Calvin Tower

A note about DUMBEST VERSION:

Twitter user John Rogers (@jonrog1), a longtime writer, offered the
following advice: if you're stuck on something and don't know how to
do it well, write "DUMBEST VERSION" at the top of the page, and then
write something. Having something is better than nothing, and you can
always revise it later when you have a better idea of how it should
go. This is a system that I use frequently. If I don't know how best
to implement something, I'll often comment /* DUMBEST VERSION */ and
get something down. This is the ideal place for you, the reader, to
give me advice, should you choose to do so. They're the good learning
opportunities for me.
