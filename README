============================== SCRATCHAPIXEL IMPLEMENTATION ==============================

A C implementation of the C++ code hosted on scratchapixel.com

I'm doing this for fun and for learning.

Day 2 update: I'm starting to understand the draw of C++. So far I've
written two classes and about six hundred lines of code that would
have gone much quicker if I had been using C++. I'm beginning also to
understand the benefits of object-oriented programming, albeit a much
simplified version without polymorphism or inheritence.
